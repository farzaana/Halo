Halo
=======

What it is
-----------

The aim of the application is to display a user journey that routes between 2 points on a map, based on addresses that they enter. It also displays additional data such as the distance between the points on the map, arrival and departure times, as well as directions for the walking user. 

This mini javascript application integrates with the whereismytransport API and Google Maps services. *Map bounds/searches are limited to South Africa.

Prerequisites
--------------

  * Active internet connection - the app uses external resources and needs an internet connection to download these
  * HTML5 compliant web browser with javascript enabled
